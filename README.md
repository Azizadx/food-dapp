# Getting Started with Create React App

The project includes smart contracts written in Rust, as well as front-end code written in React. The code is available in a GitHub repository, along with documentation and instructions for deployment and usage.

By leveraging the security, transparency, and scalability of the NEAR blockchain, this dApp provides a more efficient and trustworthy way for individuals and businesses to buy and sell food items. The use of a decentralized platform also eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces transaction costs.

This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community to help improve and expand the functionality of the dApp.
